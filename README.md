Hi there! I'm Weldin Dunn. This is a project I developed in the Summer of 2022 while working as an intern with Delaware Electric Cooperative. The idea of this program is to make an engaging way to think about energy production and use as well as everything behind that. We often take for granted the work that goes into keeping the lights on, so I wanted to make a way for DEC's members to experience that, whether it was just for five minutes or a daily habit.

My inspiration came from other idle games, especially Cookie Clicker (the layout and graphical style definitely shows this!). A lot of business simulators and idle games do a great job at keeping the generation of the products stimulating, but they rarely focus on the customers on the receiving end. This is how I wanted Beat the Peak to stand apart. This is an idle game where the customer is at the center.

I developed the whole program and designed all sprites myself over about 2.5 months when not working on other matters. It is far from where I would like it to be, but I am proud of this work. I had certainly never done anything this big before!

Future features:
Events:
- Effects from weather events (damage to infrastructure, increase/decrease in power production, etc.)
- Add intensity levels to weather events
- Add other random events (resource shortages, worker strikes, political changes, etc.)
- Add weather effects to "landscape profile" under events (IE show a snowy day when it is snowing/blizzard)

Other:
- Add positive/negative effects from energy sources (pollution from fossil fuels, erosion from water power, etc.)
- Add visual representations of built structures (under structures)
- Make the button more satisfying to click
- Fix hovering over upgrades bug!

This is a limited list of features. If I had unlimited time and no other obligations I would make this a very in-depth simulator!
